# Surfwave Fury - made by the Surfing Penguins 2022

## Description
Welcome to the Surfing Penguins vanilla Javascript game - SurfWave Fury!

Built using vanilla javascript, the game is a race to get the best time and win the annual penguin surf competition. Users alternate between pressing the left and right arrow keys to move the penguin, Cody, across the screen in the fastest time possible.

Your time is recorded in local storage and you are able to input a three letter name just like old arcade machines.

The world record currently stands at an insane 2.50s set my Nico Herbreteau. Have a go and see if you can beat him!
